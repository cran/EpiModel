\noindent The \texttt{EpiModel} package provides tools for building, solving, and plotting mathematical models of infectious disease in \texttt{R}. It is part of the \texttt{Statnet} suite of software for the representation and analysis of networks. \texttt{EpiModel} currently provides functionality for three classes of epidemic models and three disease types for modeling. Built-in model classes and types may be expanded by the user for new research.

\vspace{6pt}
\noindent This vignette is a placeholder for the \texttt{EpiModel} tutorials, all hosted online and external to the package to minimize overhead and provide flexibility in updates. Everything may be found at the \texttt{EpiModel} website:

\noindent There have been extensive revisions to the \texttt{EpiModel} user interface since the previous CRAN release. Names of functions, their organization within the package, and functionality have been updated. In addition to the help files, consult the software \texttt{NEWS}:
