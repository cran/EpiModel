Version 1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Model parameterization for all model classes has been substantially revised
  to improve organization and ability for expansion. Whereas previous models
  required input of parameters directly into the main functions (now: dcm, icm,
  and netsim), now the parameters are input into three parameter-processing
  functions: param, init, and control. The param function sets the core 
  epidemic parameters, the init function sets the initial conditions, and the
  control function specifies other model settings. These functions are 
  class-specific, so each function has a .dcm, .icm, or .net suffix.

* Modeling functions have been renamed for clarity and consistency: 
  - dcm is now used for deterministic compartmental models (replaces epiDCM)
  - icm is now used for stochastic individual contact models (replaces epiICM)
  - netest is now used for network model estimation (replaces epiNet.est)
  - netsim is now used for network model simulation (replaces epiNet.simTrans)

* Network models with independence between epidemic/demographic processes and 
  network structures (independent models) were previously first simulated with
  epiNet.simNet, and then those pre-simulated networks were input to 
  epiNet.simTrans. Now the network model simulation is all handled within the
  simulation function, netsim.

* Network model diagnostics have been moved from within the network estimation
  process (netest) to their own function: netdx. The parameter names for running,
  printing, and plotting the results of these diagnostics have been updated for
  consistency. See ?netdx and related functions.

* Internal model functions have been significantly revised to improve efficiency.

* The dcm function can handle model functions, parameter sets, and initial 
  conditions of arbitrary complexity. See the HTML vignette on this topic at:
  http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/NewDCMs.html

* Moved the package vignettes external to the package to reduce package size and
  build time. They are now available at the EpiModel homepage at:
  http://statnet.org/trac/wiki/EpiModel


Version 0.95

INITIAL RELEASE

* The EpiModel package provides functions for building, solving, and 
  plotting mathematical models of infectious disease.

* See the main package help function ?EpiModel-package, and the EpiModel tutorials
  online at http://statnet.org/trac/wiki/EpiModel to get started.
